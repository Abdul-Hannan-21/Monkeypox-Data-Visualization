Monkeypox Data Visualization

Overview
This Python script utilizes Plotly Express and Pandas to create a line chart visualizing the confirmed Monkeypox cases over time in European countries. The data is loaded from a JSON file containing information such as date, country, and confirmed cases. The line chart offers a clear representation of the temporal evolution of Monkeypox cases for each European country.

Key User Group
Healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers involved in monitoring and analyzing infectious diseases, particularly Monkeypox, are the primary target audience.

User Objectives
Users aim to comprehend the spread and impact of Monkeypox across European countries over time. They seek insights into the trends, identify potential hotspots, and make informed decisions based on the visualized data.

Effectiveness of Visualization
The line chart is an effective choice for depicting temporal patterns. It enables users to observe the rise and fall of Monkeypox cases for individual countries, facilitating trend analysis and comparison. The use of markers for each data point enhances visibility and provides specific information for each date.

Additional Features
Legend and Labels: The legend on the side helps users identify countries, and well-labeled axes provide clarity on the time and confirmed cases.

Interactive Plot: Users can interact with the plot, zoom in on specific time frames, and hover over data points to retrieve detailed information.

Dynamic Data Handling: The script dynamically loads data from a JSON file, allowing users to update the dataset easily.

Scalability: The script is scalable to include more features and visualizations as needed, providing a foundation for comprehensive Monkeypox data exploration.

Usage
